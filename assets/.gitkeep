# .gitignore placeholder
# Note: You would typically add actual .icns and .png files here for production
# For now, these are placeholder files that electron-builder will skip gracefully

# Assets needed:
# - icon.icns (512x512 icon for macOS)
# - dmg-background.png (540x380 DMG background image)

# You can generate these using:
# - Icon: Use an online converter or macOS's Icon Composer
# - DMG Background: Create a 540x380 PNG with your app branding
